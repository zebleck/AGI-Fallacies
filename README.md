# AGI Fallacies

A web application that showcases common misconceptions (fallacies) when discussing the risks of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and their counterarguments.

## Design Principles

### Quick Rebuttal to Misconceptions
The primary intent of this site is to serve as a quick and accessible rebuttal to the myriad of low-effort posts and debates online that dismiss the genuine risks associated with AGI. 

### Clarity and Conciseness
Each fallacy is presented clearly and concisely, allowing users to quickly grasp the core argument and its counter. The design avoids unnecessary jargon, aiming to be understandable even for those not deeply versed in AI.

### Evidence-Based Arguments
While the site is designed for quick consumption, the counterarguments are rooted in evidence and well-reasoned logic. It's not just about refuting misconceptions but doing so with substance.

### User-Centric Design
To enable responsive design across devices, we use Bootstrap 5.

### Encouraging Constructive Debate
By presenting both the fallacy and its counter, the site encourages users to engage in more informed and constructive debates about AGI. The goal isn't to end discussions but to elevate them.
